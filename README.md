# Sneakers Info Web Page

This is a mini HTML project that provides basic information about sneakers, including popular brands, features, and links to external resources.

## Features:
- **Page Title**: A title is displayed on the browser tab.
- **Navigation**: Internal links using anchor tags (`<a>`), which allow easy navigation to different sections of the page.
- **Sections**: Includes sections on sneakers, popular sneaker brands, and sneaker features.
- **External Links**: Learn more about sneakers with links to external resources.

## What I Learned:
- **Page Title**: You can add a title to your web page by using the `<title>` element inside the `<head>`. This title appears in the browser tab, but not on the page itself.
- **Anchor Tags**: `<a>` tags are used to link to internal pages, external pages, or specific content on the same page.
- **Navigation**: You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using anchor tags (`<a>`) and adding `id` attributes to the elements you want to jump to.

## Future Updates:
- **About Me**: An additional page will be added to provide more information about the author.
- **YouTube Videos**: I plan to add YouTube videos showcasing different sneakers.
- **Styling**: CSS styling will be introduced in the future for a more polished look.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sneakers-info.git
